# Deep-Learning-Failure-Prediction


## Description
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and neural network modeling applied to a dataset of industrial system sensor readings. The project demonstrates the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify and predict potential faults, emphasizing the importance of advanced machine learning models in detecting anomalies in time-series data.

## Objectives
- To design and evaluate LSTM-based models for fault detection in industrial systems.
- To investigate different LSTM architectures and their efficacy in recognizing and predicting faults based on sensor data.
- To provide a methodological framework that could be adapted to similar industrial fault detection tasks.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset Tennessee Eastman Process is popular benchmark for failure prediction and comprises various sensor readings collected over time from an industrial system. It is designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of machine learning models that can detect and predict operational anomalies.
